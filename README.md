# Privacy-Preserving Voting System with FHE

A decentralized application for privacy-preserving voting using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology on the blockchain.

## Overview

This project leverages FHE technology to enable secure, private, and transparent voting. Built on Zama's fhEVM technology, it ensures complete voter anonymity while maintaining verifiable results.

**This repository contains two frontend implementations:**

| **Framework** | Vanilla JavaScript | React 18 + TypeScript |
| **Build Tool** | None (direct browser) | Vite 5 |
| **Development** | Open HTML file | `npm run dev` |
| **Type Safety** | ❌ No | ✅ Full TypeScript |
| **Hot Reload** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Component Architecture** | ❌ Monolithic | ✅ Modular components |
| **SDK Integration** | ⚠️ Basic | ✅ @fhevm/universal-sdk |
| **Best For** | Quick testing, prototypes | Production applications |
| **Recommended** | 🔵 Learning/Testing | 🟢 Production Use |

## Core Concepts

### Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)

This project uses FHE technology to perform computations on encrypted data without decryption. Votes are encrypted on-chain and tallied homomorphically, ensuring:

- **Complete Privacy**: Individual votes remain encrypted and anonymous
- **Verifiable Results**: Final tallies are accurate and tamper-proof
- **Trustless System**: No central authority can access individual vote data

### Smart Contract Architecture

The FHE-enabled smart contract manages:
- **Encrypted Vote Storage**: All votes are stored in encrypted form
- **Homomorphic Vote Tallying**: Vote counting happens on encrypted data
- **Time-based Phases**: Automatic voting period management
- **Access Control**: Only authorized voters can participate

## Technology Stack

## How It Works

### Voting Process

1. Event Creation: Admin creates a voting event with candidates
2. Voter Authorization: Eligible voters are authorized by admin
3. Anonymous Voting: Voters cast encrypted votes during voting period
4. Vote Tallying: Homomorphic computation counts votes on encrypted data
5. Result Reveal: Admin triggers decryption after voting ends
6. Winner Announcement: Results are published on-chain

### Privacy Guarantees

- Vote Secrecy: Individual votes are never revealed
- Encrypted Tally: Vote counts are computed on encrypted data
- Delayed Decryption: Results only revealed after voting closes
- Immutable Record: All actions are recorded on blockchain

## Use Cases

Perfect for conducting anonymous voting in:

- Community Governance: DAO voting and proposals
- Awards and Recognition: Anonymous selection processes
- Organizational Decisions: Internal company voting
- Public Polls: Survey and opinion collection
- Election Systems: Democratic voting processes

## Key Features

### For Voters
- Anonymous voting without revealing identity or choice
- One vote per event for fair democratic process
- Real-time voting status tracking
- Transparent and verifiable results

### For Administrators
- Easy event creation and management
- Flexible candidate registration
- Granular voter authorization control
- Automated time-based voting phases

### Technical Features
- Encrypted on-chain storage using FHE
- Gas-optimized contract design
- MetaMask integration
- Responsive web interface
- Comprehensive test coverage

## Choosing Between Implementations

### Use the Original HTML Implementation When:
- ✅ You need a simple, lightweight solution
- ✅ No build process required
- ✅ Quick prototyping or testing
- ✅ Hosting on simple static servers
- ✅ Minimal dependencies preferred

### Use the React TypeScript Implementation When:
- ✅ Building a production application
- ✅ Need type safety and better IDE support
- ✅ Want modular, maintainable code
- ✅ Planning to extend functionality
- ✅ Prefer modern development workflow
- ✅ Need hot module replacement during development
- ✅ Want to integrate FHEVM SDK properly
- ✅ Require component-based architecture

**Recommendation:** For new projects or production use, the **React TypeScript implementation** (`AnonymousSportsVoting/`) is recommended as it provides better code organization, type safety, and maintainability.

## Security Considerations

- All votes are encrypted using FHE before storage
- Time-locked phases prevent manipulation
- Access control restricts administrative functions
- Voter authorization prevents Sybil attacks
